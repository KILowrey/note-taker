## Description

[Link to Heroku deployment](https://damp-basin-09779.herokuapp.com/)

This is a Note Taker for week 11 of my coding bootcamp. The assignment was to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. With an express backed and a JSON file for a database.

I was a lot of fun to work on just the back-end of an assignment! I hope there are more like this in the future.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project.

## Usage

This application is uploaded on Heroku. Navigate it as you would any other web-site!

I have had some problems with one of the node_modules not working as expected for some reason. Hopefully with an update that will no longer be a problem.
